# AI Notes

Scaffold only. Core tasks remain:
- Implement Shopify GraphQL pagination for last 14 days, paid and not fully fulfilled.
- Log cost/throttle, backoff on throttling.
- Parse priority from tags; apply whitelist/blacklist and log exclusions.
- Transform to everstox payload and build POST request (do not send).
- CLI should trigger import and print summary.
